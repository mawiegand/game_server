The NPC placement script was started at <%= @report[:started_at] %> 
and finished running at <%= @report[:finished_at] %>.

It placed a total of <%= @report[:num_npcs_placed] %> npc armies.

Min army: <%= @report[:min_size] %> units
Max army: <%= @report[:max_size] %> units

Now we have a total of <%= @report[:num_npcs] %> npc armies in this wonderful world
with an average size of <%= number_with_precision(@report[:average_size], :precision => 1) %> units.

Whack On!
