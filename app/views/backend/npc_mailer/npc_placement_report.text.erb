The NPC placement script was started at <%= @report[:started_at] %> 
and finished running at <%= @report[:finished_at] %>.

It placed a total of <%= @report[:num_npcs_placed] %> npc armies.

Min army: <%= @report[:min_size] %> units
Max army: <%= @report[:max_size] %> units

Now we have a total of <%= @report[:num_npcs] %> in this wonderful game with an 
average size of <%= @report[:average_size] %> units.

Whack On!
