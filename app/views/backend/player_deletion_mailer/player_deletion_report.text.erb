The player deletion script was started at <%= @report[:started_at] %> 
and finished running at <%= @report[:finished_at] %>.

It removed a total of <%= @report[:deleted_players].count %> inactive players today:

<% @report[:deleted_players].each do |player| %>
  <%= player.name %>
<% end %>

Tomorrow will be removed a total of <%= @report[:players_getting_inactive].count %> inactive players:

<% @report[:players_getting_inactive].each do |player| %>
  <%= player.name %>
<% end %>

Whack On!
