  <!-- ATTENTION: NEVER put any new buildings inbetween two existing while a
       round is running. Creating or deleting buildings there will cause a 
       change of building IDs and mess up the database for the existing
       players. Always add new buildings, independent of their group or 
       category, ONLY to the END OF the FILE. NEVER change the sequence. 
       Only after a round has ended, those new buildings can be re-sorted. 
       Afterwards you need to do a rake db:reset! -->
